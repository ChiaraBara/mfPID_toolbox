Matlab toolbox for the estimation of the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) terms. 
This toolbox allows for computing the information decomposition terms in the frame of a target variable and two or three source variables. 
It is equipped of functions for implementing both the mixed discrete and continuous random variables estimation approach introduced by Bar√† et al. and the original formulation of Williams and Beer working on discrete variables.
